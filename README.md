### Hello, I am Ashvala Vinay! 

I am a researcher, musician and engineer with a PhD in Music Technology at Georgia Institute of Technology.

My pinned repos show off some of what I work on - Audio Quality analysis, Deep Learning problems, designing apps that explore sound synthesis and music perfomance.

I'm also in a live-coding band with my good friend [ijc8](https://github.com/ijc8) called [Merge Conflict](https://mergeconflict.live). Check us out at a show soon!
